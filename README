These are the rmfd files.

rmfd is a fork of rm from GNU Coreutils version 8.5.  It has been forked to add
the new option --warnings (short name -w).  This option reads a list of path
names from $HOME/.rmfd/warn.list and warns the user if the rmfd invocation will
result in the removal of any of those files.  The user is issued a prompt to
continue, and if the user declines, nothing is removed (there is an inherent
race condition, so once it starts removing files, it will still check the list
and never remove a file without prompting, but at that point it can't restore
the files that were already deleted).

It attempts intelligent handling of symbolic links.  If a symbolic link is put
in the list, rmfd will warn if either the link or the target of the link is
going to be deleted.  If a directory is found in the list, it will furthermore
warn if a recursive removal of the directories contents are attempted through
a symbolic link.

Other than that, and without the --warnings option, rmfd behaves identically to
rm.  It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for /bin/rm.
