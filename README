If you are reading this, you probably have the wrong branch checked out from
git.  The master branch is meant to more-or-less mirror GNU coreutils' version
of rm, although there are certainly major differences in the environment since
all the other programs have been left out.  The branch where all the action is
is rmfd.  The purpose of that branch is to be able to see the conceptual
differences between GNU coreutils' rm and rmfd by comparing the branch rmfd to
master.  Please check that one out instead.
