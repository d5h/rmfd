* Check for removing every file in a directory on the warn list.  The idea is
  to catch 'cd important_directory ; rm *'.
* Don't create the warnings table until later, so rm -w --help is just as fast
  as normal.
* Document with info?
* Look for optimizations; we make a lot of stat(2) and lstat(2) calls.
