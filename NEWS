* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

** Bug fixes

** New features

  rm now prints "WARNING:" in bright red when stderr is attached to a
  terminal.

** Changes in behavior

* Noteworthy changes in release 0.7 (2010-08-19) [beta]

** Bug fixes

  rm -w doesn't crash if warn.list is missing.

* Noteworthy changes in release 0.6 (2010-08-19) [beta]

** Bug fixes

  rm -fw now returns the correct exit status (0) if it finds a missing
  file.

** New features

  rm now checks to see if every non-dot file in any directory in the
  warnings table is being removed and warns if so.  The idea is to
  catch mistakes like, "cd important_dir ; rm *".

** Changes in behavior

  rm won't load the warnings table with the --help option, so it's
  more efficient but won't give you an invalid warn.list error.
