# TODO: download gnulib if we don't have it.

# NOTE: This includes way more than is probably necessary just to build
# rm; much of it is included through system.h.  As I'd prefer for this not
# to be a permanent fork, I'd rather have a slightly bloated build than to
# go editing files I don't need to.  I don't think this will make rm any
# bigger.
